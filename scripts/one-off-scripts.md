# One-off Scripts

These are all scripts that have been run once for a single purpose. They've generally been run manually using the rails console.

These *should not* be run again as they *will affect the live database*, and will probably error out and break a bunch of stuff.

However, I think it's useful that we include them in the codebase for visibility--so that others can see the operations that have been performed. It will also help us if we have to do any similar tasks again.
